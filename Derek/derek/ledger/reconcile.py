"""Reconcile a freshly extracted candidate set against the existing ledger.

This is the layer that satisfies "must correctly identify new rules, rules
which have been altered and rules which have been removed". Octavius could
not do any of the three (postmortem F7).

Nothing here guesses. Lineage is matched by exact and normalised string
equality only; anything that does not match cleanly is surfaced for a human
decision rather than resolved by similarity heuristics, because a wrong
lineage silently transfers a human's acceptance onto a rule they never saw.
