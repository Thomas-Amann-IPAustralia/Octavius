"""The rule ledger: Derek's single source of truth about rules.

One ledger entry per rule. The entry carries three provenance tags, which
are the project's non-negotiable requirement:

1. **derivation** — how we arrived at this rule.
2. **detection**  — the method through which the rule should be implemented.
3. **source**     — the original Style Manual rule the implementation came from.

Every other field exists to prevent a specific, documented Octavius failure.
Cross-references to ``docs/00-postmortem-octavius.md`` are given inline so
that nobody removes a field without first reading why it is there.

The ledger is JSONL in git. It is not a database: every decision is a
reviewable diff, attributable and revertable (ADR-008).
