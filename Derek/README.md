# Derek

A plain-language compliance system for Australian Public Service content, built on the
[Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/).

Derek finds text that breaks a style rule, flags it with a calibrated confidence, and
lets the user keep the original or accept a change. It is the successor to **Octavius**.

> **Read [`docs/00-postmortem-octavius.md`](docs/00-postmortem-octavius.md) first.**
> Octavius shipped 801 rules that, fired at the Style Manual's own professionally-edited
> prose, raised **1,438 findings per 1,000 words** — roughly 1.4 violations per word on
> text that is by definition correct. Every rule passed its own test suite. Most of
> Derek's design is a direct response to a specific, documented failure there, and the
> postmortem says which.

## What is different this time

| | Octavius | Derek |
|---|---|---|
| Rule inventory | LLM proposed 3,114 "rules" from 181 pages | **546** read deterministically off document structure |
| Reproducibility | Re-running produced a different rulebook | Byte-identical across runs; CI-enforced |
| Polarity | No field for it; 62% of rules detected the compliant pattern | `violation_condition` + separate compliant/violating examples, guarded three ways |
| Test data | Model-generated alongside the rule it tested | **489 gold sentences** harvested from the manual's own *Write this* / *Not this* blocks |
| Quality gate | None; product-level suppression hid the problem | Dogfood gate on raw output, in CI |
| Human review | 3,114 rows, reviewed after the fact | Nothing loads until a human accepts it |
| Rules | Model-generated Python, `exec()`d with full builtins | Declarative data from a closed matcher vocabulary |
| Change detection | Trusted the sitemap's `lastmod`; never noticed removals | Content hashes, weekly full re-hash, explicit add/alter/remove changesets |

---

## Status

Foundations built; no rules reviewed yet — by design.

| | |
|---|---|
| Offline Style Manual snapshot | 186 pages |
| Eligible rule-source pages | 128 |
| Deterministic rule candidates | **546** (460 imperative · 61 negative · 25 modal) |
| With hand-authored gold examples | 318 (58%) |
| With *paired* compliant + violating examples | 77 |
| Gold example sentences | 489 |
| Accepted into the runtime | **0** |

Built and tested: the snapshot layer (content-addressed, with add/alter/remove
changesets), deterministic extraction, the rule ledger, the dogfood gate, and the
triage UI. 67 invariant tests pass.

Not yet done: the snapshot has not been run against the live site from this repository,
and **no rule has been triaged**. The first triage pass is the next task — see
[`docs/04-roadmap.md`](docs/04-roadmap.md).

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Rebuild the rule ledger from the corpus (deterministic, no model calls)
python -m derek.extract.build

# Prove reproducibility — fails if rebuilding would change the ledger
python -m derek.extract.build --check

# Fire accepted rules at the Style Manual's own prose
python -m derek.eval.dogfood

# Triage rules — keyboard-first: A accept, R reject, D defer, N not-text
python tools/review/server.py

# Refresh the offline snapshot (needs requirements-pipeline.txt)
python -m derek.corpus.snapshot --sweep-slice 0

# Reproduce the Octavius postmortem figures
python -m derek.eval.dogfood --octavius reference/octavius-v1/rules_working_draft.v1.jsonl

pytest tests/ -v
```

## How it works

```
  stylemanual.gov.au
        │  Layer 0 — SNAPSHOT        content-addressed; add/alter/remove changesets
        ▼
  corpus/pages/**.md
        │  Layer 1 — EXTRACTION      pure function of the corpus; no model
        ▼
  546 candidates (stable uid, statement, heading path, gold examples)
        │  Layer 2 — INTERPRETATION  model proposes, human decides
        ▼
  ledger/rules.jsonl
        │  Layer 3 — DETECTION       accepted rules only
        ▼
  Tier 0 deterministic · Tier 1 classifier · Tier 2 generator (deferred)
        │  Layer 4 — INTERFACES
        ▼
  HTTP · MCP · CLI · LLM middleware · review UI
```

Each layer is reproducible from the one below it. Full detail in
[`docs/01-architecture.md`](docs/01-architecture.md).

### Rules are read off the document, not invented

The Style Manual states its rules as headings:

```markdown
### Place a comma after adverbs and other introductory words
### Use a comma after phrases and clauses that change the whole sentence
### Avoid beginning a sentence with a string of numbers and dates
```

So the rule inventory is a pure function of the corpus. A model may later classify or
formalise a candidate; it may never decide that one exists. That is what makes
"two runs extract the same rules" true by construction rather than by hope.

### The manual ships its own test set

```markdown
#### Write this
There were 16.5 million people enrolled to vote in Australian elections on 18 April 2019.

#### Not this
On 18 April 2019, 16.5 million people were enrolled to vote in Australian elections.
```

122 *Write this* blocks, 169 *Not this* blocks, 1,055 *Example* blocks — hand-authored,
correctly polarised, attributable to a specific rule by position. Octavius generated its
own test strings and inverted them wholesale. Derek harvests these instead, and they are
the seed for the fine-tuning set.

### Every rule carries three provenance tags

1. **`derivation`** — how we arrived at the rule
2. **`detection`** — the method through which it is implemented
3. **`source`** — the original Style Manual rule, verbatim, with URL and page hash

Plus deontic modality, clarity (and the formal `specification` where an ambiguity was
resolved, with the assumptions logged), scope, polarity, calibrated confidence, and the
full review history. See [`docs/03-rule-ledger-schema.md`](docs/03-rule-ledger-schema.md).

## Documentation

| Document | What it is for |
|---|---|
| [00 — Postmortem: Octavius v1](docs/00-postmortem-octavius.md) | Every failure mode, with reproducible evidence. **Read before changing extraction or detection.** |
| [01 — Architecture](docs/01-architecture.md) | The layered design and what each layer guarantees |
| [02 — Decision log](docs/02-decisions.md) | 19 ADRs: what was decided, why, what it costs |
| [03 — Rule ledger](docs/03-rule-ledger-schema.md) | The data contract |
| [04 — Roadmap](docs/04-roadmap.md) | Phases, and how to get from 546 candidates to working rules |

## Repository layout

```
corpus/       offline Style Manual snapshot + eligibility + changesets
ledger/       rules.jsonl — the rule ledger
derek/        corpus · extract · ledger · detect · eval · interfaces
schema/       machine-checkable ledger contract
tools/        review UI
docs/         the documentation set above
reference/    curated markdown; Octavius v1 artifacts (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
tests/
```

`reference/octavius-v1/` exists for two purposes only: a **recall checklist** (did the
deterministic extractor find what a model found?) and a **permanent negative test set**
for the dogfood gate. It is never a source of rules.

## Design principles

1. **Each layer is reproducible from the one below it.** Otherwise you cannot tell a
   Style Manual change from model variance.
2. **A model may propose; only a human decides.** Nothing reaches the runtime without an
   explicit human transition.
3. **Rules are data, not code.** Declarative matchers from a closed vocabulary, never
   `exec()`.
4. **Polarity is explicit everywhere.** Detect the violation, never the compliant pattern.
5. **Measure quality before any suppression.** Budgets and dedup make a broken rulebook
   look merely noisy.
6. **Use the cheapest tier that works.** No model where a regex will do.
7. **Deferred features get their structural accommodation now.** Word round-tripping and
   MCP serving are deferred; the indirection that makes them cheap is already in place.
